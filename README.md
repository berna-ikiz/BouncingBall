This project is a simple interactive React Native animation Challange.

## ðŸš€ Features
- A bouncing ball anmation using the animated API.
- The bounce height is dynamically calculated based on the position and available screen space.
- If there is not enough space to bounce, an alert is shown.
- The ball never moves otside the screen bounds.

## ðŸ“± How It Works
1. User taps anywhere on the screen 
2. A ball appears at tab location
3. If the screen has enough vertical space, the ball performs a bounce animation.
4. Otherwise, a message is shown: "There is no enough space, the ball can't bounce."
